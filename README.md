Hi, my name is Timi! My interests lie in the intersection of AI and Data Science and I love building applications (e.g. ways to build robust [RAG](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag) architectures) and exploring ways to utilise the latest advancements in the field in a practical way. Academically, I completed my MSc. in Statistics, where I wrote my thesis on the <a href="https://timif2.github.io/AI Safety Thesis - Timi Folaranmi.pdf">adversarial robustness of Spiking Neural Networks</a>, intersecting AI Safety and neural networks.

  <p style="flex: 1;">
    As part of my Master's thesis, I wrote a technical report studying the resistance to adversarial attacks of rate-encoded Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) across various white-box and black-box attacks. This study explores the robustness of SNNs in different adversarial scenarios and proposes methods to enhance their security and reliability.
