Hi, my name is Timi! My interests lie in the intersection of AI and Data Science and applying AI to unlock additional value in business data (e.g. ways to build robust [RAG](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/rag) architectures) and exploring ways to utilise the latest advancements in the field in a practical way. Academically, I completed my MSc. in Statistics, where I wrote my thesis on the [adversarial robustness of Spiking Neural Networks](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NdYRftmOiM_erzlxs9h_YgUNy9scDw4m/view?usp=drive_link), exploring AI safety in these networks.

# Research and Papers

### Adversarial Robustness of Rate - Encoded Spiking Neural Netowrks
[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NdYRftmOiM_erzlxs9h_YgUNy9scDw4m/view?usp=drive_link) and [Code](https://github.com/timif2/snnthesis)

As part of my Master's thesis, I wrote a technical report studying the resistance to adversarial attack of rate - encoded SNNs, across various white and black box attacks. 

### Modelling Heart Conditions and Train Delays Using Machine Learning Methods
[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_0EtthoHm4a43jCS9MVekJJbdfj-IMJE/view) and [Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ux7vyic87vTSMUXvnXjPnkLclO2G_KN/view?usp=drive_link)

Two studies applying Random Forest using R: 1. Classifying patient heart conditions from ECG data (classification); 2. Building train delay prediction model (regression). This was joint work with Weiyun Wu, Alastair Harrison and Ying Zhan. 

### An Exploration into Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with comparisons to other Classification Methods
[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dnVUuo5qzrcsPZSsihKi5bjX9aBOk1Ba/view) and [Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16frjD8d4BP-dOteUeaN2nMpkQiJi_vaH/view?usp=sharing)

A study on background, performance and evaluation of Support Vector Machines in solving classification problems (in Python), compared with other classification methods. This was a collaboration with Jake Dorman, Anas Almhmadi and Rishabh Agarwal.
