# Data Science Projects 

This page a collection is a collection of my selected data science related projects, used to explore components of machine learning. My projects in statistical analysis can be found here.

At the moment, from a more theoretical perspective, I am interested in the applications of Transformer architecture. As such, a few of my projects are exploring applications them. The versatile and exciting applications in NLP and Computer Vision are what I find interesting.

I am currently developing an educational web app on transformers. If you would like to contact me about this please *send me an email.*

## Neural Networks

### Classification using neural networks in PyTorch

Neural network for basic multi - class classification. 

## Computer Vision

### Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch in PyTorch

A paper implementation of the (original) Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture using PyTorch. Applies convolutional neural network (CNN) method.

## Reports and papers

### Modelling Heart Conditions and Train Delays Using Machine Learning Methods

Two studies applying Random Forest using R: 1. Classifying patient heart conditions from ECG data; 2. Building train delay prediction model. You can view the full report here. This was a collaboration with Weiyun Wu, Alastair Harrison and Ying Zhan. The accompanying presentation slides for the heart conditions project can be viewed here.

### An Exploration into Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with comparisons to other Classification Methods

A study on background, performance  and evaluation of Support Vector Machines in solving classification problems (in Python), compared with other classification methods. You can view the full report here, with accompanying presentation slides here. This was a collaboration with Jake Dorman, Anas Almhmadi and Rishabh Agarwal

## Recommendation Systems

### Collaborative filtering based system

Implementation of a collaborative filtering  (CF) based system looking at user - based and item based CF and Alternating Least Squares (ALS) on a restaurant problem.

## Paper Implementations

I tend to learn better when trying to apply concepts from papers. Here are some basic paper implementations using *labml*:

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implementation using PyTorch

A labml based implementation of the original GANs paper (link)
