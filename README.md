# Data Science Projects 

This page a collection is a collection of my selected data science related projects, used to explore components of machine learning. My projects in statistical analysis can be found here.

At the moment, from a more theoretical perspective, I am interested in the applications of Transformer architecture. As such, a few of my projects are exploring applications them. The versatile and exciting applications in NLP and Computer Vision are what I find interesting. You can find my CV/resume [here]()

I am currently developing an educational web app on transformers. If you would like to contact me about this please send me an [email](mailto:timicsbe@gmail.com)

## Computer Vision

### Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch in PyTorch
[GitHub](https://github.com/timif2/computer-vision/blob/bed7418b0a8a61bc8b31797573696afd6f055b51/Vision%20Transformer%20(ViT)%20from%20scratch%20in%20PyTorch%20(Paper%20Implementation).ipynb)

A paper implementation of the (original) [Vision Transformer (ViT)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929) architecture using PyTorch. Applies convolutional neural network (CNN) method. It follows from code by [Daniel Bourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke/pytorch-deep-learning/)

## Reports and papers

### Modelling Heart Conditions and Train Delays Using Machine Learning Methods
[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_0EtthoHm4a43jCS9MVekJJbdfj-IMJE/view)     [Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_Ux7vyic87vTSMUXvnXjPnkLclO2G_KN/view?usp=drive_link)

Two studies applying Random Forest using R: 

1. Classifying patient heart conditions from ECG data;
2. Building train delay prediction model.
This was joint work with Weiyun Wu, Alastair Harrison and Ying Zhan. 

### An Exploration into Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with comparisons to other Classification Methods
[Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dnVUuo5qzrcsPZSsihKi5bjX9aBOk1Ba/view)     [Presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16frjD8d4BP-dOteUeaN2nMpkQiJi_vaH/view?usp=sharing)

A study on background, performance and evaluation of Support Vector Machines in solving classification problems (in Python), compared with other classification methods. This was a collaboration with Jake Dorman, Anas Almhmadi and Rishabh Agarwal

## Recommendation Systems

### Collaborative Filtering system
[GitHub](https://github.com/timif2/recommendation-systems/blob/1fee42d5c8305d58d31c5993037980a3a8bc509e/Collaborative_filtering.ipynb)

Implementation of a collaborative filtering (CF) based system looking at user - based and item based CF and Alternating Least Squares (ALS) on a restaurant problem.

## Paper Implementations

I tend to learn better when trying to apply concepts from papers. Below are some basic paper implementations directly using [labml](https://github.com/labmlai) and most of their implementation code:

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) implementation using PyTorch
[GitHub](https://github.com/timif2/paper-implementations/blob/f94bfe42c01132bd3303eeee7e0143e7e8a14572/Generative%20Adversarial%20Network%20(GAN)%20with%20PyTorch.ipynb)

### Vision Transformer (ViT) implementation
[GitHub](https://github.com/timif2/paper-implementations/blob/f94bfe42c01132bd3303eeee7e0143e7e8a14572/Vision%20Transformer%20(ViT)%20using%20PyTorch.ipynb)
