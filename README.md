# Data Science Projects 

This page a collection is a collection of my selected data science related projects, used to explore components of machine learning. My projects in statistical analysis can be found here.

At the moment, from a more theoretical perspective, I am interested in the applications of Transformer architecture. As such, a few of my projects are exploring applications them. The versatile and highly interesting applications in NLP and Computer Vision are what I find incredible, and Iâ€™m looking to learn how to improve these architectures. 

I am currently developing an educational web app on transformers. If you would like to contact me about this please *send me an email.*

## Neural Networks

### Classification project using neural networks in PyTorch

Neural network for classification.

## Computer Vision

### Vision Transformer (ViT) from scratch in PyTorch

A (paper) implementation of the Vision Transformer architecture using PyTorch.

## Reports and papers

### Modelling Heart Conditions and Train Delays Using Machine Learning Methods

You can view the full report here. This was a collaboration with Weiyun Wu, Alastair Harrison and Ying Zhan. You can view accompanying presentation slides for the heart conditions project here.

### An Exploration into Support Vector Machines (SVMs) with comparisons to other Classification Methods

You can view the full report here, with accompanying presentation slides here. This was a collaboration with Jake Dorman, Anas Almhmadi and Rishabh Agarwal

## Recommendation Systems

## Paper Implementations

I tend to learn better when trying to apply concepts from papers. The below are some paper implementations using *labml*.
